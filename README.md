### Evaluate! _and_ Evaluate Automatically

MOOC Wizard can help you evaluate others’ homework to save your time. Click **evaluate!** button to evaluate for a single time. When **evaluate automatically** is on, once you enter the evaluation page, evaluation will be done automatically.

### Hide Useless Elements _(experimental)_

Using this function, the 163-MOOC web page will be nice and clean.

### Seamless Video Playback _(under development)_
This function is under development, but you are encouraged to contribute to it.

### Reorganise Assignments _(experimental)_

Assignments on 163-MOOC are by default displayed in chronological order. MOOC Wizard can pin the assignments that are about to expire on top, and list the passed ones below.
